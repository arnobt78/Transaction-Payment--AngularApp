## Code Samples & Key Scripts

Below are example code snippets and patterns youâ€™ll find in this project:

### Example: AngularJS Module Setup

```javascript
angular.module('xtanApp', ['ionic', 'ngAnimate'])
  .controller('TransactionController', function($scope, TransactionService) {
    $scope.transactions = [];
    $scope.fetchTransactions = function() {
      TransactionService.getAll().then(function(data) {
        $scope.transactions = data;
      });
    };
  });
```
---

### Example: Fetching Data from Backend

```javascript
.factory('TransactionService', function($http) {
  return {
    getAll: function() {

    }
  };
});
```

### Example: Displaying Transaction List in AngularJS

```html
<ion-list>
  <ion-item ng-repeat="txn in transactions">
    <span>{{txn.date}}: {{txn.amount | currency}}</span>
    <span class="item-note">{{txn.category}}</span>
  </ion-item>
</ion-list>
```

### Example: Sending OTP for Security

```javascript
$scope.verifyOTP = function(otp) {
  $http.post('/api/verify-otp', { otp: otp })
    .then(function(response) {
      if (response.data.success) {
        // proceed with transaction
      }
    });
};
```
